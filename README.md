# nodejs upload with progress bar

a web interface with progress bar uploading, and Nodejs, Multer and Express is backend, very simple version.

we need a web interface for the browsers to upload large videos files between computers in our local network, 

for local network file share is painful with unstable windows authentications.

So two useful techniques :

1 upload with progress bar and retrieve file name from server side.

2 upload system with nodejs, Multer and Express which can be setup in minutes

the original codes are from different websites on the internet, and we modified the codes and made some provement. 

start the server with command:
			

	node server.js 


The server should be loaded at https://locahost:668/ and then try https://locahost:668/upload with progress bar.
